## ðŸ“š What did I learn?
Since it is my first React project, I learned about lots of things, but the most important ones for me was:
- Components: reusable pieces of code that can be joined to create complex user interfaces;
- Properties: used to pass data between components;
- States: makes it possible to update a component's data and re-render the component when the data changes.
